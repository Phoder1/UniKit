# com.alontalmi.utillities
Collection of my C# and Unity utillities packed as a unity package.

The collection is aimed at more general scripts that usually require less dependencies and are easy to use.

Absolute dependencies:
- UniRx
- DoTween (free is ok)


Some scripts use Odin Inspector but are wrapped in Odin_Inspector define, so they support projects without odin inspector.

The collection adds a Phoder1Core define which can be used to determine if the package is used in the project.

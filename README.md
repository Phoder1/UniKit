# com.alontalmi.utillities
Collection of my C# and Unity utillities packed as a unity package.

The collection is aimed at more general scripts that usually require no dependencies and are easy to use.

Some scripts do require other packages to be installes (they're wrapped in define statements), those packages are:
- UniRx (Very much required and reccomended!)
- Zenject (Only Utillities to help use Zenject, I do no use injection in most of the scripts)
- Odin inspector (most scripts do not require it, but all scripts support projects with odin installed)
